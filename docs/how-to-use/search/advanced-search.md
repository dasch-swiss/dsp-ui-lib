# Advanced Search Component

## Introduction

The `AdvancedSearchComponent` allows for the creation of complex queries using a graphical widget.
The widget's contents are then turned into a string representing a Gravsearch (SPAQRL) query to be sent to DSP-API.

A query consists of the following elements:
- ontology (data model) selection
- selection of a resource class belonging to the selected ontology (optional)
- specification of properties, comparison operators, and values.
