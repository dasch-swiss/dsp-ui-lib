<!-- OLD playground with the two resource list and grid views implemented in standalone mode;
    TODO: will be reactivated as soon the dsp-list-view is implemented in search playground but this needs an additional PR --
<button mat-raised-button color="accent" (click)="showGrid = !showGrid">
    Display as {{showGrid ? "LIST" : "GRID"}}
</button>
