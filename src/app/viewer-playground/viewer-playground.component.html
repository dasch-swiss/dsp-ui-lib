<p>The <strong>DspViewerModule</strong> contains different component to display a resource.
    The example here shows the usage of <span>dsp-resource-view</span> which combines smaller
    components like one of the representation viewer or the value components. All of them can
    also be used individually.</p>

    <dsp-resource-view [iri]="resource" [showToolbar]="true" (openProject)="openProject($event)"></dsp-resource-view>
