 * This service is used as a way to enable components to communicate with each other no matter how nested they are.
 * This is intended to provide a cleaner way to emit events from nested components than chaining '@Outputs'.
 * The ValueOperationEventService essentially creates a direct communication channel between
 * the emitting component and the listening component.
